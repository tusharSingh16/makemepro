      As children, we absorb information and learn from experiences that mold us into who we are. Many individuals impact a child's life, but the most powerful and influential role lies in a devoted teacher; a teacher provides growth to students as a gardener would to a garden of flowers.

      Each child can bloom into a thriving flower so long as you water their garden with optimism, love, patience, and guidance. Throughout my educational experiences, I was lucky enough to have educators who poured their knowledge and optimism into me, and now I would like to reciprocate that back to students who are in the position I was once in.

      Balancing life and school is hard enough for a student, but a powerful and caring teacher can steer you in the right direction. In this autobiography, you will read about my educational background, experiences that influenced my decision to become a teacher, and what I believe the role of a teacher should be in a student's life.

      As a student, I went to multiple schools, I went to three different elementary schools, two middle schools, and two high schools in Brownsville, and through it all, I had great experiences.
